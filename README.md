# Game Concept
● I wanted to create a game that builds on the concept of our first assignment.
● I believe it was a good idea to build a 2d soccer game that was 2 players.
● The rules and game design are very simple, anyone can pick it up and be able to play with it.

# Sequence of Play
● To start the game the player must press the space key.
● The sequence of play is similar to a game of pong.
● The ball starts in the middle and each player has to hit the ball and try to score into the
opponents goal.
● Once the ball enters the goal the game awards a point to opposite player.
● The game continues like this until the score reaches 5 points then the game will pause and
show the winner as text on top of the screen. 

# Rules-
● Each player starts on their side and the ball starts in the middle
● When the game starts the ball drops and the players can move any direction
● Each player has a (kick) function which pushes the ball towards the goal when they touch
it
● The goal of the game is to get the ball to the opponents goal
● The game ends when either player get to 5 points

# Improvements to make
● Hitbox more accurate
● Game Over/Restart screen
● Better animation for character/ball
● More interesting level design
● Custom Assets
● More sounds
